# ov51x-jpeg

This repository is an archive of the modified linux driver for JPEG-enabled Omnivision cameras from way back then.

Code has since then been merged into the linux kernel and jpeg decompression is provided via
[libv4l](https://github.com/philips/libv4l) -- or at least that's how it was last time I checked..
